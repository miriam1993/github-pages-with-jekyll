#The Fires Continue
The fires have not moved closer to Alderpoint but remain prevalent. 
We could definitely use any amount of rain but it doesn't come. The smoke visibility was a bit better today
but not great, and I can definitely feel it in my lungs.
However, I sit and drink a glass of green tea with peppermint and everything calms down. I feel okay.
